			Born and raised in Campinas city - SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil. </br>
			Since I was a child I have always been fascinated by movies that could teach me something new, computers and its mysteries, games, Science and bringing ideas to life.</br>
			The previous combination shaped me into a curious developer that is always trying to develop something new with tools I'm still not familiar with.</br>
			Nowadays I'm working as a mobile application developer and UI/UX designer at app affairs GmbH. in Munich, Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. Inspired by diversity and curious by nature, I challenge myself every single day to be a better person and to learn something new.</br>
