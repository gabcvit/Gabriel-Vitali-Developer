Since I was a child I have always been fascinated by computers, eletronic games, science and bringing ideas to life. Nowadays I'm working as an intern in mobile applications development in Munich, Germany. Inspired by diversity and curious by nature, I challenge myself every single day to be one step closer to a successful professional career abroad.</p>
